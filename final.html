                I have been excited to take this course since I enrolled in the Computer Science program at JMU. After graduating in May, I want to use my degree to design websites and web applications and this class gave me a glimpse at what I may be doing on a smaller scale. I really enjoyed the design of this class in terms of the 'flipped classroom' teaching style where we read the book and taught ourselves to the best of our ability and then applied that knowledge to labs in class where we could get clarification / help when needed. This definitely helped me to understand the material. By reading the book and completing the labs, I was able to do all the projects efficiently and really understand what I was doing. If I was teaching this class in the spring, I would likely keep the same format to give the students plenty of oppurtunities to practice the skills presented in the book. I also thought the blog posts were a good way to use new skills and implement other techinques that weren't covered in class to make your projects and post more unique such as the javascript side-nav I used in both my Project 1 and Blog. I wish we continued those throughout the semester.

                Another change I would make to the class would be to spend more time on Web Services and Web Applications. These concepts were challenging and it seemed a little rushed since there is so many concepts associated with them. As we have talked about in class, I think an introduction class to HTML and CSS that is a pre-requisite to this class would be very beneifical. By making this class into two classes, every topic would get ample time and it would give incoming students a good foundations to start CS 347. We could have easily spent the entire semester on Web Serivces and Web Applications alone. If the class were to be split, Project 2 and 3 can bulked up to make up for the lack of Project 1 which could be done in the introduction class as a semester long project with deliverables throughout the semester to show gradual progress.

                Overall, I would keep this class very similar to the current format besides from breaking it up into 2 classes. I think it works well and meets the course's goal of teaching students beginner web development with several different programming languages. There is a reason that this class is always full within minutes of enrollment opening each semester.
