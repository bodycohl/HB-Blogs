            This week we are learning about flex box in CSS which can be extremely challenging to understand but also extremely powerful once you can use if efficiently. Flex box has helped solve many problems such as aligning text or an image on a browser page or properly aligning several objects in a straight line. Although these sound like simple tasks, it was very complicated to do them correctly for a long time until flex box was introduced. My blog this week focuses on the basics of Flex Box and elaborates on the things that confused me even after reading the assigned chapter.

            I found a good website that highlighted the terminology that can be confusing and used tons of diagrams to explain the components better. A flex box is composed of two pieces: a container and the flex items. There is typically only one container and then as many flex items are needed.
