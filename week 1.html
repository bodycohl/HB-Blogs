            The first article I looked at outlined basic HTML elements that are important to understand in order to truly understand HTML. HTML elements are the components that structure a website and are made up of two components, a tag and attributes. A tag is the starting mark-up element that is typically enclosed in angled brackets which denote the beginning of an element. Some examples of HTML tags are &lthtml&gt, &ltbody&gt and &ltp&gt. All of these tags symbolize a different component that can be included within a webpage. Once we have the tag, we can add attributes that give a tag additional information about what its purpose is. An example of an attribute would be the alt parameter in an img tag such as: &ltimg src = cat.png alt = A black cat&gt. The &ltimg&gt component is the tag and the alt component would be an attribute since it is not necessary but adds to the understanding of what the &ltimg&gt tag is supposed to be showing. This portion of the article really helped me understand the difference which will definitely be helpful when creating a website since I have a better understanding of what is necessary and what is additional information that is useful but not required. This article also includes more information about other HTML topics and is a great resource for anyone who is starting to learn HTML and really wants to understand the basic concepts before diving in the first link in the References section.

            I also watched a video regarding the division between structure and presentation in HTML and CSS. I wanted to look into this topic a little more because I was initially confused when I read the section of Chapter 2 regarding it. The reason I was confused is that you can use tags and attributes such as &ltfont color = red&gt to add dimension to your webpages but it is frowned upon since it muddles structure and presentation. This video helped me understand the difference better and grasp what is applicable for the structure side and the presentation side. For HTML code, it is important to focus on structuring your webpage in a way that makes sense to someone using the page. You want to have a title at the very top, typically in a bigger font which can be denoted by categorizing it with an &lth1&gt tag. For any section headings, we would want them to be noticeable but not as big as the title so we could use the tag &lth2&gt and so on. This creates a sense of structure in our document. On the other hand, CSS is reserved for adding presentation elements to a web page such as background color:
            
            <br>
            <br>
<pre>
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}</pre>
            <br>
            This example code would be stored in a separate file called a stylesheet and there would be references within the HTML document to the stylesheet to determine where the background color would be set to light blue in the webpage. Since it is in two separate files, it keeps the idea of structure vs. presentation separate and makes it easier to distinguish between the two.

            Although we have not gotten to this point yet, I am super excited to eventually be able to include aesthetic elements to my websites. Overall, this video just helped to clarify the division between the two ideas and showed that when used appropriately and together, anyone can create amazing content.

            I also wanted to include this screenshot since it emphasized my ideas from the last paragraph well. It just outlined which elements are structural and which are for aesthetic purposes and provides an easy reference guide for several staple web page elements.

            <img src = "week1.png" alt = "Structural vs. Presentation Elements" width="400" height="250">
                
        </p>
