            A tricky concept to undestand in CSS is the idea of positioning an element in relation to other elements on the page. This property 'position' is used to define the type of positioning used for a particular element. There are 5 options for this property shown below. In addition to setting the 'position' property, you can also set 'bottom', 'top', 'left', and 'right' which will only work in relation to the 'position' attribute. In this section, I will explain what each property option does as well as provide examples to make it easier to undestand as I know I am still trying to grasp this concept too.
<pre>
.example {
    position: static | fixed | relative | absolute | sticky;
}
</pre>
            <br>

            <h4>Position: Static</h4>
            <p>An element is positioned to static by default so there is no need to specify if unless you want to add 'bottom', 'top', 'left' and 'right' attributes to the element. An element with a static position will flow the normal flow of the page. 
<pre>
example.static {
    position: static;
    border: 3px solid rgb(151, 179, 214);
}

&ltbody&gt

    &ltdiv class = "static"&gt
    This div element has position: static;
    &lt/div&gt
&lt/body&gt
</pre>

            <img id = "image" src = "static.png" alt = "Static Example" width = "400">
            </p>

            <h4>Position: Fixed</h4>
            <p>
<pre>
example.fixed {
    position: fixed;
    border: 3px solid rgb(151, 179, 214);
}
                
&ltbody&gt
                
    &ltdiv class = "fixed"&gt
        This div element has position: fixed;
    &lt/div&gt
&lt/body&gt
</pre>
                
            <img id = "image" src = "fixed.png" alt = "Fixed Example" width = "400">
            </p> An element with a fixed postion is anchored to the viewport and doesn't move when scrolling throught a page. It is important to use the 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' properties to position the element in the correct spot on the viewport. Another important thing to consider with a fixed position element is that the element won't take up space in the flow. It almost resides on top of everything else which can be good for things such as navigation bars. 

            <h4>Position: Relative</h4>

            <h4>Position: Absolute</h4>

            <h4>Position: Sticky</h4>
