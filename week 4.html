            A tricky concept to undestand in CSS is the idea of positioning an element in relation to other elements on the page. This property, 'position' is used to define the type of positioning used for a particular element. There are 5 options for this property:
<pre>
.example {
    position: static | fixed | relative | absolute | sticky;
}
</pre>
            In this section, I will explain what each property option does as well as provide examples to make it easier to undestand as I know I am still trying to grasp this concept too.

            <h4>Position: Static</h4>

            <h4>Position: Fixed</h4>

            <h4>Position: Relative</h4>

            <h4>Position: Absolute</h4>

            <h4>Position: Sticky</h4>

        </p>
